# Hare Simulation Model

Modelling the Euopean brown hare to mitigate bionenergy-driven biodiversity decline.
An attempt to reconstruct the model by Langhammer, M., & Grimm, V. (2020)

## RQ: What effects do selected mitigation measures have on long-term hare population development in the reference landscape Münsterland?
